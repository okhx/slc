# Silicate

This is the main repository for the Silicate bot. 

## Versioning

Currently the bot is in **alpha**, which means we use `1.0.0-alpha.XX` builds.
When releasing a beta build, use `1.0.0-beta.XX` builds.

Upon release, we will migrate to a different versioning system - preferably something like `2026.01-01` for the first build in January 2026.

## Compiling

1. Clone [`tabby`](https://github.com/silicate-bot/tabby) into lib/tabby. Make sure you're on the `legacy-v1` branch (until we migrate lol).
2. Run `build.bat` or `build-rel.bat` if you're compiling for public use. (Use `build.sh` if you're on Linux!)

## Contributing

Please use feature branches. Use clang-format for formatting your code (unless it makes it horribly unreadable).
Currently we do not have automated testing. Please test the features you're implementing/changing and related components before releasing builds.
